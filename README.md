Welcome to the Astronomy Study Tool!

Step 1: Go to http://faculty.etsu.edu/SMITHBJ/f2019/quizzes.html for ASTR 1010 (or relevant for 1020)

Step 2: Open desired quiz practice questions

Step 3: Copy paste ALL (ctrl+A -> ctrl+C) into a new text file and save.

Step 4: Open Astronomy Study Tool.exe and select open file to open the new text file you just created.

Everything else is pretty self explanatory from here...

A few notes: You don't need to open the text file again after opening it once.

			- You can open new text files in between quizzes without closing the program
			 
			- The popup: Total Questions: 150
						Total Answers: 150
						User Answers: 10
						Correct Answers: 10
			- is meant as confirmation that the program has read in everything properly. If their isn't two matching pairs of numbers, something has gone awry.
			 
			- Always double check the actual answer sheet if you are unsure if the program graded properly :)
